Icons for keywords are from game-icons.net
Here is a quick breakdown of usage:

Are the icons royalty free?
They are provided under the CC-BY license (or even Public Domain for some of them), which means that you can use them freely in your projects as long as you credit back the authors.

How to credit the authors?
It mainly depends of your project. For instance, if you use them on a website add a link on a credit page. If you make a board / card game, add a mention in the last pages of your rules book. If it's a video game, the mention can be accessible from a menuâ€¦

Is there anyway I can help?
Sure! If you're an artist, try to contribute. If not, spread the love on social medias!
